 <p>50, 000 feet in the air, let me take you on a ride (yeah)<br/>
Girl, it feels so amazing when we can get away just you and I (oh)<br/>
Another dimension, you take me away from reality<br/>
Got me running away from the world with you (yeah)<br/></p>
<p>
Everything stops in time in this moment it's you I see (yeah)<br/>
These stars in the sky they remind me of you and me<br/>
Nobody compares to you, no, no<br/>
Did not care and now I care for you, no, no<br/>
Take you to another place, I don't mind for you and I to escape<br/>
Can't you see the vision?<br/></p>

Gimme a feeling, through the galaxy we go<br/>
Take you to the Moon, girl, I know you down to roll (down to roll)<br/>
Looking down with a bird's eye view<br/>
No doubt in my mind, that's a moment I know that<br/>
Nobody compares to you, no, no<br/>
Did not care and now I care for you, no, no<br/>
